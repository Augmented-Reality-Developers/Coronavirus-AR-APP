I have made an Augmented Reality(AR) APP using Unity Engine and Vuforia
AR SDK to show the working of Coronavirus in reality. This APP
augments the working model of Coronavirus in reality.
But I want to improve this APP so that it can augment the real-time
statistics of Coronavirus patients in reality.

( What I want to do is to scrape the web data using APIs in
Unity so that I can use
this data to display it
inside the APP(augment it) whenever I use this AR APP.

)

But I am new to Web Development, I only know upto CSS, have to learn JS.
So, if anyone know's scraping web data in Unity using C#, please
contribute for this project.


My project can be found in this repo:-

Is anybody willing to contribute for this project??
